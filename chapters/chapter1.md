<exercise id="1" title="Type I & II errors">

What is a type I error?

<choice id="1">
<opt text="Null hypothesis is false but not rejected">

This is not the correct answer.

</opt>

<opt text="Null hypothesis is true but not accepted" correct="true">

Good job!

</opt>

<opt text="Not enough information to accept or not accept">

This is not the correct answer.

</opt>
</choice>

What is a type II error?

<choice id="2">
<opt text="Null hypothesis is false but not rejected" correct="true">

</opt>

<opt text="Null hypothesis is true but not accepted">

This is not the correct answer.

<exercise id="2" title="Central Limit Theorem">

In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in some situations, when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a bell curve) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. 

The theorem is a key concept in probability theory because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions. 

How many observations are generally required for CLT to apply?

<choice>
<opt text ="0">
This is not the correct answer.
</opt>
<opt text ="15">
This is not the correct answer.
</opt>
<opt text ="30" correct="true">
This IS the correct answer.
</opt>
<opt text ="50">
This is not the correct answer.
</opt>
<opt text ="200">
This is not the correct answer.

<exercise id="3" title="Statistical power">

For a binary hypothesis test it’s the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis (H0) when the alternative hypothesis is true.

Which error type does statistical power relate to?

<choice>
<opt text="Type I error">
</opt>
<opt text="Type II error" correct="true">
</opt>
</choice>

<exercise id="4" title="Selection bias">

Selection (or ‘sampling’) bias occurs in an ‘active,’ sense when the sample data that is gathered and prepared for modeling has characteristics that are not representative of the true, future population of cases the model will see. 
That is, active selection bias occurs when a subset of the data are systematically (i.e., non-randomly) excluded from analysis.

<exercise id="5" title="code example">

This is a code exercise. The content can be formatted in simple Markdown – so
you can have **bold text**, `code` or [links](https://spacy.io) or lists, like
the one for the instructions below.

- These are instructions and they can have bullet points.
- The code block below will look for the files `exc_01_03`, `solution_01_03` and
  `test_01_03` in `/exercises`.

<codeblock id="01_03">

This is a hint.
